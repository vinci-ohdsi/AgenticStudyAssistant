Study intent: Identify clinical risk factors for receiving a diagnosis of Parkinsons disease for older adult patients. The Parkinsons phenotype is defined as an EHR diagnosis of Parkinsons or record of a drug with a Parkinsons disease indication but excluding patients who are on neuroleptic medications. 
Key risks: prevalent-user bias; improper time-at-risk; limited overlap.
